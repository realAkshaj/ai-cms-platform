## 🛠️ The Tech Stack

I chose these technologies because they're modern, reliable, and perfect for scaling:

### Frontend (The Pretty Stuff)
- **Next.js 15** - React framework with amazing developer experience
- **TypeScript** - Because catching bugs early is better than debugging later
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS that makes styling actually enjoyable
- **Lucide Icons** - Beautiful, consistent icons

### Backend (The Smart Stuff)  
- **Express.js** - Fast, minimalist web framework
- **Prisma** - Database toolkit that makes queries a breeze
- **JWT Authentication** - Secure, stateless authentication
- **bcrypt** - Industry-standard password hashing

### Infrastructure (The Reliable Stuff)
- **PostgreSQL** - Rock-solid relational database
- **Redis** - Lightning-fast caching and sessions
- **Docker** - Containerized development environment
- **GitHub** - Version control and collaboration

## 🚀 Getting Started (It's Actually Easy!)

### What You'll Need
- Node.js 18+ (the JavaScript runtime)
- Docker (for databases - don't worry, it's automated)
- A code editor (VS Code is great)
- About 10 minutes

### 1. Get the Code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/realAkshaj/ai-cms-platform.git
cd ai-cms-platform
```

### 2. Set Up Environment
```bash
# Copy the example environment files
cp .env.example .env
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local

# The defaults work fine for development!
```

### 3. Install Everything
```bash
# Install dependencies (this might take a minute)
npm install

# Install app-specific dependencies
cd apps/api && npm install
cd ../web && npm install
cd ../..
```

### 4. Start the Databases
```bash
# This starts PostgreSQL, Redis, and MongoDB in Docker
docker-compose up -d

# Check they're running (you should see 3 containers)
docker ps
```

### 5. Set Up the Database
```bash
cd apps/api

# Generate the database client
npx prisma generate

# Create the database tables
npx prisma db push

cd ../..
```

### 6. Start Everything
```bash
# This starts both frontend and backend
npm run dev
```

That's it! Open http://localhost:3000 and you should see the beautiful registration page.

## 💭 Why I Built This

Traditional CMS platforms feel outdated. They're either too simple for serious projects or so complex that you need a PhD to use them. I wanted to build something that:

- **Looks modern** - Because good design matters
- **Works everywhere** - Mobile, tablet, desktop
- **Scales with you** - From personal blog to enterprise
- **Embraces AI** - The future of content is intelligent
- **Stays secure** - Your data deserves protection

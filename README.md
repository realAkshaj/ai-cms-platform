## 🛠️ The Tech Stack

I chose these technologies because they're modern, reliable, and perfect for scaling:

### Frontend (The Pretty Stuff)
- **Next.js 15** - React framework with amazing developer experience
- **TypeScript** - Because catching bugs early is better than debugging later
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS that makes styling actually enjoyable
- **Lucide Icons** - Beautiful, consistent icons

### Backend (The Smart Stuff)  
- **Express.js** - Fast, minimalist web framework
- **Prisma** - Database toolkit that makes queries a breeze
- **JWT Authentication** - Secure, stateless authentication
- **bcrypt** - Industry-standard password hashing

### Infrastructure (The Reliable Stuff)
- **PostgreSQL** - Rock-solid relational database
- **Redis** - Lightning-fast caching and sessions
- **Docker** - Containerized development environment
- **GitHub** - Version control and collaboration

## 🚀 Getting Started (It's Actually Easy!)

### What You'll Need
- Node.js 18+ (the JavaScript runtime)
- Docker (for databases - don't worry, it's automated)
- A code editor (VS Code is great)
- About 10 minutes

### 1. Get the Code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/realAkshaj/ai-cms-platform.git
cd ai-cms-platform
```

### 2. Set Up Environment
```bash
# Copy the example environment files
cp .env.example .env
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local

# The defaults work fine for development!
```

### 3. Install Everything
```bash
# Install dependencies (this might take a minute)
npm install

# Install app-specific dependencies
cd apps/api && npm install
cd ../web && npm install
cd ../..
```

### 4. Start the Databases
```bash
# This starts PostgreSQL, Redis, and MongoDB in Docker
docker-compose up -d

# Check they're running (you should see 3 containers)
docker ps
```

### 5. Set Up the Database
```bash
cd apps/api

# Generate the database client
npx prisma generate

# Create the database tables
npx prisma db push

cd ../..
```

### 6. Start Everything
```bash
# This starts both frontend and backend
npm run dev
```

That's it! Open http://localhost:3000 and you should see the beautiful registration page.

## 🔌 API Endpoints (What's Working)

### Authentication (All Working!)
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Create a new account
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Sign in to your account  
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Sign out safely
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get your profile info
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Refresh your session

### Coming Soon
- Content management endpoints
- AI-powered content generation
- Media upload and processing
- Analytics and insights

## 🗄️ Database Design

Right now we have a solid foundation with these tables:

- **Users** - Your account information
- **Organizations** - Multi-tenant support (teams/companies)
- **Sessions** - Active login sessions
- **RefreshTokens** - Secure token management

Coming up:
- **Content** - Blog posts, pages, products
- **Media** - Images, videos, documents
- **AIAnalysis** - Smart content insights

## 🔒 Security (We Take This Seriously)

- **Password Protection** - bcrypt hashing with 12 salt rounds
- **JWT Tokens** - Secure, stateless authentication
- **Input Validation** - Everything gets checked before hitting the database
- **Rate Limiting** - Protection against spam and attacks
- **CORS** - Proper cross-origin security
- **Security Headers** - All the standard protections

## 🧪 Testing It Out

### Manual Testing Checklist
- ✅ Register a new account
- ✅ Login with your credentials  
- ✅ See the dashboard
- ✅ Logout and login again
- ✅ Try invalid passwords (should show errors)
- ✅ Check responsive design on mobile

### What to Try Next
1. Register at http://localhost:3000/auth/register
2. Use a real email and strong password
3. Login at http://localhost:3000/auth/login
4. Explore the dashboard
5. Test the logout function

## 🚀 Deployment (When You're Ready)

### Environment Variables for Production
```bash
DATABASE_URL=your-production-database-url
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-refresh-token-secret
REDIS_URL=your-redis-instance
```

### Recommended Platforms
- **Frontend**: Vercel (perfect for Next.js)
- **Backend**: Railway or Render (easy Node.js deployment)
- **Database**: Neon or PlanetScale (managed PostgreSQL)
- **Redis**: Upstash (serverless Redis)

## 💭 Why I Built This

Traditional CMS platforms feel outdated. They're either too simple for serious projects or so complex that you need a PhD to use them. I wanted to build something that:

- **Looks modern** - Because good design matters
- **Works everywhere** - Mobile, tablet, desktop
- **Scales with you** - From personal blog to enterprise
- **Embraces AI** - The future of content is intelligent
- **Stays secure** - Your data deserves protection
